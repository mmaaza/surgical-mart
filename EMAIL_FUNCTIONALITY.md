## Testing

### Test Endpoint
**URL**: `POST /api/test/test-order-email`

**Body**:
```json
{
  "testEmail": "your-email@example.com"
}
```

This endpoint sends a test order confirmation email with mock data to verify the email functionality.

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these environment variables are set in your `.env` file:

```env
BREVO_API_KEY=your_brevo_api_key
EMAIL_FROM=your_sender_email
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=Surgical Mart Nepal
CLIENT_URL=your_frontend_url
```

## Usage

### Automatic Email Sending
When a user places an order through the checkout process, the confirmation email is automatically sent to the customer's email address provided in the shipping details.

### Manual Testing
Use the test endpoint to verify email functionality:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/test/test-order-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"testEmail": "test@example.com"}'
```

## Error Handling

The email functionality includes comprehensive error handling:
- Email sending errors don't affect order creation
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Network error handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Email templates for order status updates
2. Order tracking links in emails
3. Personalized product recommendations
4. Multi-language email support
5. Email analytics and tracking
6. Email queue system for retry logic

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email not sending**: Check BREVO_API_KEY and email configuration
2. **Images not loading**: Verify CLIENT_URL is set correctly
3. **Template rendering issues**: Check for missing order data
4. **Mobile display problems**: Verify responsive CSS is working

### Debug Steps

1. Check server logs for email sending errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test with the test endpoint first
